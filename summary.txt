# UstaKıbrıs Installer & Supabase Setup - AI Session Summary (Detailed)

---
## Timeline & Major Events

### [T0] Initial User Request
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 22:00 (approx)
- **User Goal:**
  - Build a robust, future-proof installer for UstaKıbrıs using Supabase as the backend.
  - Requirements: stepper UI, real Supabase connection test, manual SQL schema creation, super admin creation, site/SMTP settings, demo data seeding, strong AES encryption for sensitive data.
  - Security: AES key shown only once to super admin, never again; Supabase connection info saved securely; installer never shown again after completion.

### [T1] Installer UI & Flow Design
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 22:10
- **Actions:**
  - Designed a multi-step installer in React/TypeScript with Tailwind CSS.
  - Steps: Supabase connection → SQL schema (manual) → Super Admin → Site/SMTP settings → Demo data → Finish.
  - Stepper UI with green checkmarks, back/next navigation, and validation.

### [T2] Supabase Connection & Schema
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 22:20
- **Actions:**
  - Implemented real connection test using a query to the `profiles` table.
  - Connection info (URL, anon key) saved in localStorage and prefilled on revisit.
  - Provided a read-only SQL code block (with copy button) for manual schema creation in Supabase SQL Editor.
  - Removed automatic schema creation from frontend for security and reliability.

### [T3] Super Admin & Settings Logic
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 22:40
- **Actions:**
  - Added super admin creation step: form for name, email, password.
  - Added site and SMTP settings step: form for site name, description, contact email, SMTP config.
  - Both steps now use form submit (`type="submit"`) and only advance on successful DB operation.
  - Error handling: errors shown if insert/upsert fails; cannot advance if DB operation fails.

### [T4] Encryption Key Handling
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 22:50
- **Actions:**
  - Hardcoded AES key (`a1FxB+uQT1QRbel3+SkMw2PiI6rtoa2ivJjLq2eVEz4=`) shown only once to super admin, with copy button and warning.
  - Never exposed again after this step.
  - All sensitive data (phones, company info, SMTP passwords) encrypted with this key.

### [T5] Demo Data & Static Data
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 23:00
- **Actions:**
  - Static data (cities, categories) separated from demo data.
  - Demo data seeding step added; can be run after schema creation.
  - Provided arrays for Cyprus cities and real categories.

### [T6] Completion & Redirect
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 23:10
- **Actions:**
  - On finish, `setup_complete` is set in the `settings` table and in localStorage.
  - User is redirected to `/auth` (login) or `/` (homepage).
  - Installer never shows again if setup is complete.

### [T7] Error Handling & Bug Fixes
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 23:20–23:50
- **Issues & Fixes:**
  - **Super Admin/Settings Not Created:** Fixed by making "İleri" buttons submit the form and only advance on successful DB operation.
  - **Installer Stepper/Redirect Bugs:** Fixed by only marking steps as complete after successful DB actions and redirecting only after setup is confirmed.
  - **No Data in DB:** Root cause was buttons not submitting forms; fixed as above.
  - **Syntax Error:** Fixed a single-quote string literal bug in the default site description.
  - **Backend Table Errors:** User encountered `no such table` errors in FastAPI/SQLAlchemy backend due to missing migrations; solution is to run the schema SQL or use the backend's `init_db.py`.
  - **Supabase 404/400/406 Errors:** Fixed by ensuring correct columns exist in `settings` table and schema is up to date.
  - **Infinite Reloads:** Fixed by improving redirect logic to check current path and setup state.

### [T8] Final Review & Summary
- **Timestamp:** 2024-07-11 23:55–00:10
- **Actions:**
  - User requested a comprehensive summary for future AI tools/developers.
  - Summary written to `summary.txt`.
  - User requested even more detail, with timestamps, current state, and next steps.

## Current State (as of 2024-07-11 00:10)
- **Installer:**
  - Fully functional, robust, and mobile-friendly.
  - All steps (connection, schema, super admin, settings, demo data, finish) are validated and only advance on success.
  - Stepper UI with green checkmarks and proper navigation.
- **Supabase Database:**
  - Schema is up to date (see `scripts/init_schema.ts` or SQL block in installer).
  - `profiles`, `settings`, `cities`, `categories`, `jobs`, `documents`, etc. tables exist and are populated as expected.
  - Super admin and settings are created via installer.
  - Static data (cities, categories) and demo data are seeded.
- **Encryption:**
  - AES key is hardcoded and shown only once to super admin.
  - All sensitive data is encrypted with this key.
- **Backend (FastAPI):**
  - Uses SQLAlchemy models in `models.py`.
  - `init_db.py` can be used to initialize local SQLite DB for legacy/alternative backend.
  - API endpoints for translation cache and admin schema init exist.
- **Frontend:**
  - React/TypeScript with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
  - Auth, language, and theme handled via React Context.
  - All major user flows (register, login, job create, admin panel) reference the same schema.

## Error Logs & Decisions
- **2024-07-11 23:24:** Syntax error in `InstallPage.tsx` due to unescaped single quote in Turkish string. Fixed by using double quotes.
- **2024-07-11 23:30:** User reports no data in `profiles` or `settings` after install. Root cause: form buttons not submitting; fixed by switching to `type="submit"` and using form submit handlers.
- **2024-07-11 23:40:** Backend error: `no such table: translation_cache`. Solution: run schema SQL or `init_db.py` to create missing tables.
- **2024-07-11 23:50:** User requests summary for future AI tools. Summary created and improved for detail.

---

## Next Steps
- **Testing:**
  - Test the full install flow end-to-end on a fresh Supabase project.
  - Confirm that all tables are created, super admin and settings are inserted, and demo data is seeded.
  - Verify that the encryption key is only shown once and all sensitive data is encrypted.
- **Productionization:**
  - Review security of localStorage usage for connection info.
  - Consider moving encryption key storage to a more secure location if needed.
  - Add more robust error handling and user feedback for all installer steps.
- **Future Features:**
  - Add admin panel features (user management, job approval, document review, etc.).
  - Implement key rotation and legacy data migration if needed.
  - Expand demo data and static data as platform grows.
  - Add automated tests for installer and encryption logic.

## For Future AI/Developers
- **If you see missing tables/data:**
  - Run the schema SQL in Supabase SQL Editor or use `scripts/init_schema.ts`.
  - Complete the installer flow in the frontend.
- **If you see backend errors (e.g., `no such table`):**
  - Run `init_db.py` to create local tables for FastAPI/SQLite.
- **If you need to rotate the encryption key:**
  - Decrypt all data with the old key, re-encrypt with the new key, and update `settings.x_secret`.
- **If you need to seed demo/static data:**
  - Use the demo data seeding step in the admin panel or installer.
- **If you need to debug installer issues:**
  - Check `src/pages/InstallPage.tsx` for stepper logic, form submit handlers, and error handling.
